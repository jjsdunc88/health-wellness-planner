                The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PAG) are published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
                These guidelines are recommendations for how much physical activity adults and children should do each week.
                The guidelines are based on scientific evidence and are designed to help people improve their health and reduce their risk of chronic diseases.</p>
            <br />
            <ul>The PAG for adults are as follows:

                <li>Adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week.</li>
                <li>Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms) on two or more days a week.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <ul>The PAG for children and adolescents are as follows:

                <li>Children and adolescents aged 6â€“17 years should have 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of physical activity each day.
                    Of that 60 minutes, at least 30 minutes should be moderate-to-vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.</li>
                <li>Children and adolescents should also do muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms) on two or more days a week.</li>
            </ul>
