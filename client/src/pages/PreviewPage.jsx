            <Paragraph>
                Macros are short for macronutrients. They are the nutrients that your
                body needs in large amounts, specifically carbohydrates, fat, and
                protein.

            <Paragraph>
                Calorie & macro counting is a way of tracking your intake of macros.
                This can be helpful for people who are trying to lose weight, gain
                muscle, or improve their overall health.

                The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PAG) are published by
                the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These guidelines
                are recommendations for how much physical activity adults and children
                should do each week. The guidelines are based on scientific evidence and
                are designed to help people improve their health and reduce their risk
                of chronic diseases.

                    Adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic
                    activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each
                    week.

                    major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and
                    arms) on two or more days a week.

                    least 30 minutes should be moderate-to-vigorous-intensity aerobic
                    activity.
