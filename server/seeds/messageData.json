    "messageBody": "Based off the information you provided and using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to estimate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and considering your moderate exercise level, your estimated calorie intake should be around 2600 calories to maintain your current weight.\n\nSince you're looking for weight loss, you need a calorie deficit. For healthy and sustainable weight loss, a deficit of 500 to 1000 calories per day is recommended, which equates to losing 1 to 2 pounds per week. Let's take a moderate approach and target a daily intake of 2100 calories.\n\nYour macros would break down as follows:\n- Proteins: Aim for around 1 gram per pound of body weight when trying to lose weight. In your case, this would be approximately 180 grams of protein per day, equating to 720 calories.\n- Fats: Aim for around 0.3 to 0.4 grams per pound of body weight. In your case, that's between 54 to 72 grams of fat per day, equating to around 500-650 calories. \n- Carbs: The remaining calories in your diet, after protein and fat are considered, will come from carbohydrates. So, after subtracting protein and fat calories from your total daily calorie intake, you'd have about 730-880 calories left for carbs, equating to around 182-220 grams of carbs.\n\nRemember, these numbers are rough estimates and one-size does not fit all. Also, listen to your body and adjust as necessary. Good luck on your weight loss journey!",
